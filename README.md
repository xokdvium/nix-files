# ‚ùÑÔ∏è xokdvium's NixOS flake

This repository contains my personal flake. It builds my development machines and deploys part of my infrastructure

If you don't know what nix, nixos and flakes are then please take a look at [introduction-to-flakes](https://nixos-and-flakes.thiscute.world/nixos-with-flakes/introduction-to-flakes/)
by [ryan4yin](https://github.com/ryan4yin/). Basically it's a functional package manager on steroids which empowers to user to build whatever they want. This flake leverages this power to configure
my machines in a declarative way. Flakes have locked dependencies which ensures that my system configuration is reproducible and works out of the box.

## üß¨ Structure

I prefer to keep my home configuration in [home-manager](https://github.com/nix-community/home-manager/) since it's not always possible to use NixOS (although not for the lack of trying).
This way I can get my development environment up and running on any distribution by using [standalone](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/index.xhtml#sec-install-standalone/) home-manager.

## üîß Development

This flake provides a `devShell` and `direnv` configuration.
The latter is most convenient (if you have `nix-direnv` installed):

```bash
‚ùØ direnv allow
```

Otherwise you can enter the shell via `nix-shell` or `nix develop` commands.
Both are supported and versioned with `flake.lock` file.
The flake has several formatters configured via [treefmt-nix](https://github.com/numtide/treefmt-nix).
This file is my go-to for preconfigured linters and formatters for CI/CD and development.
All files can be formatted and checked with the following command:

```bash
‚ùØ just lint
```

## üöÄ Deployment

You can view all targets by running `just -l`:

```bash
‚ùØ just --list
Available recipes:
    boot *FLAGS
    check
    check-format
    collect-garbage
    format
    f                   # alias for `format`
    lint
    l                   # alias for `lint`
    local-switch *FLAGS
    lsw *FLAGS          # alias for `local-switch`
    run-workflows
    r                   # alias for `run-workflows`
    switch *FLAGS
    sw *FLAGS           # alias for `switch`
```

To rebuild the system configuration run:

```bash
‚ùØ just switch
```

To rebuild locally, without using [distributed builds](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Distributed_build) it's possible to run
a local switch:

```bash
‚ùØ just local-switch
```

## üéí Binary Cache

This flake builds a lot of packages from source, since I like to use the latest unstable branches to get
the latest updates as fast as possible. I run [zfs](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/ZFS) root for my desktop systems.
But due to certain usability issues I've switched to [cachyos](https://cachyos.org/) kernel from [nyx](https://github.com/chaotic-cx/nyx/).
To remedy the long build times I've spun up a personal binary cache and set up [distributed builds](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Distributed_build).
